1. The value of the variable i will be printed to the console which is 3.
2. The last calculated discounted price is printed which is 150.
3. The last calculated discounted price is printed which is 150.
4. The function will return an arry [50,100,150] which are the prices after the 50% discount has been applied.
5. At line 12 a ReferenceError will occur because i is declared with let so it is only accessible in the for loop and can't be accessed any where else.
6. At line 13 a ReferenceError will occur because the let discountedPrice is in the for loop so it is not accessible anywhere else.
7. The finalPrice wil be printed which is the new array [50,100,150] after the 50% discount has been applied.
8. The function will return [50,100,150] which are the prices after the 50% discount has been applied. 
9. At line 11 a ReferenceError will occur because i is not defined outside the for loop since it was declared with let. You can't access the variable i.
10. At line 12 the code will log the length of the prices array which is 3 in this case. 3 is logged to the console.
11. This function will return an array [50,100,150] which are the prices after the 50% discount has been applied.

  a. student.name

  a. '3' + 2 = '32'
  b. '3' - 2 = '1'
  c. 3 + null = '3'
  d. '3' + null = '3null'
  e. true + 3 = '4'
  f. false + null = 0
  g. '3' + undefined = '3undefined'
  h. '3' - undefined = 'NaN'

  a. '2' > 1 = true
  b. '2' < '12' = true
  c. 2 == '2' = true
  d. 2 === '2' = false
  e. true == 2 = true
  f. true === Boolean(2) = false
15. The == and === are used for comparison. The == is the equality operator so it compares two values for eqaulity after converting their types. They have to be a common type. The '===' operator is a strict equality that compares two values but unlike == no conversion is done. They must be the same type to be considered equal.
